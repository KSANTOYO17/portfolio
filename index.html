                    <h4>API Integration and Creation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          Added and modified REST APIs using Spring MVC and Spring Security.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Integrated third-party travel booking REST APIs such as Ventrata and Rezdy for creating and canceling travel bookings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Reshaped third-party API responses into Smartvisit’s in-house API response format to enable a unified approach across multiple REST API sources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Documented new APIs and related business logic for maintainability and knowledge sharing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Used GitHub for code versioning and collaborative development.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                          <strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

                          <li><h4>Customer Side</h4></li>
                          <li>This is used by the customers to buy tickets to a specific attraction and initiate payment</li>
                          <li><h4>Contributions</h4></li>
                          <li><ul>
                            <li>
                              Created functionality where the UI dynamically displays a set of fields based on the selected attraction. Field types (TextField, TextAreaField, SingleSelectField, Numeric, Dropdown, Time, etc.) are generated from the booking API response. Implemented field-level validation using react-hook-form and Zod.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Developed functionality to create a Cart object, store it in Redis via Spring Boot REST API, and save the Cart ID in the browser’s localStorage. Implemented Zustand for global state management to ensure cart data is accessible across the entire application.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Built a page to collect customer booking and billing information (name, email, contact number, etc.) with validation using react-hook-form and Zod.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Implemented a payment page integrating Stripe Payment API. Used ExpressCheckoutElement to enable Google Pay and Apple Pay (when supported) and PaymentElement for manual card entry.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Developed a webhook API triggered by Stripe after payment completion. This initiates Order creation in the backend using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Oracle SQL, and triggers a Server-Side Event (SSE) notification tied to the Cart ID.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Implemented Server-Side Events (SSE) to allow the frontend to subscribe after payment initiation and receive real-time updates once order processing is completed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Created a Success page to notify customers that their transaction has been successfully completed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Conducted product investigations on slow-running APIs to identify performance bottlenecks.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Created technical design and process flow documentation for reference and maintenance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Conducted demos and walkthroughs of the application for executives.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><h4>Admin Side</h4></li>
                          <li>This is used by Smartvisit’s Admin to configure products, see list of orders etc.</li>
                          <li><h4>Contributions</h4></li>
                          <li>

                                <li>
                                  Developed REST APIs to retrieve all Shops (with filters and pagination), create new Shops, and update existing Shops using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA. Implemented the same API design pattern for other entities such as Discounts, Products, and more.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Created a REST API to return Shop performance metrics (active shops, inactive shops, top-performing shop, lowest-performing shop, highest growth rate, and lowest growth rate) based on date filters using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and Oracle SQL.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Developed a REST API to return specific Shop statistics such as growth rate and number of orders using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Oracle SQL.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Built a UI page displaying a paginated and filterable list of Shops, with functionality to create, update, and set a Shop to inactive. Implemented form validation using react-hook-form. Created similar management pages for Discounts, Products, and other entities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Developed a UI feature allowing users to configure processing fees per transaction for each Shop in the webshop.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Created a dashboard UI page displaying Shop metrics, including total number of Shops, highest and lowest sales per Shop, and Shop-specific statistics (e.g., number of orders), with date-based filtering capabilities.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Created technical design and process flow documentation for maintainability and knowledge transfer.
                                </li>
                                <li>
